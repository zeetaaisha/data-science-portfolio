# Data Science Portfolio
This repository showcases a collection of my data science projects, analyses, and visualizations that I have worked on, presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Feel free to explore the projects below and delve into the code, findings, and insights presented.

## Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install the necessary dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Use a Jupyter notebook server, VScode, or similar tool to run notebooks as usual. 

## Projects
